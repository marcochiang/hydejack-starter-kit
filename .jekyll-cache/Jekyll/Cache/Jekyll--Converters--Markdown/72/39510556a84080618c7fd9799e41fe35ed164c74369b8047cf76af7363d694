<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>From 2014 to 2021 I lived in SF fostering communities in movement, art, and technology. When the pandemic hit, like many, I was lost - especially creatively. I decided I would start a new community of my own. One that would inspire me, keep me accountable, and where I can collaborate with other creatives. My first content house was born (video below).</p>

<p>Story telling is something I want to get better at so I hope to share some of my experiences via my blog <a href="https://marcochiang.com/blog">here</a>.</p>
