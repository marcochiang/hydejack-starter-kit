## My Story
I spent the last 5 years experiencing SF to the fullest making communities in movement, art, and technology. I'm still in love with this city and am now starting a life here with my partner. She keeps me humble and challenges me like no other. Together we love to travel, learn, and discover unique experiences.

Story telling is something I want to get better at so I hope to share some of my experiences via my blog [here](https://marcochiang.com/blog).
