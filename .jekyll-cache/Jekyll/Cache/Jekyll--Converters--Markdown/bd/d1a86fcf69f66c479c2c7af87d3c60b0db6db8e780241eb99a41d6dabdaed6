I"2<p>Before understanding how I even got into FAANG, you need to understand how my academic ability couldn’t have been more average. I maintained a solid B+/- all throughout high school, even dropped out of all my AP (advanced placement) classes within the first week because I forgot to do any of the summer assignments. I wasn’t particularly a high achiever compared to my “hardo” (a term I learned later on that meant try hards) peers. This isn’t a story of traditional hard work and Ivy League privelege but rather preparation and working smart.</p>
