I"<p>It was the year 2013 and I was a senior at my university which bears the infamous nickname Zoomass Slamherst. It was a really fun school but because my major was computer engineering, I didnâ€™t get to fully enjoy the social aspects of college. I mostly remember sleepless nights in the library with my fellow classmates. As seniors, we were required to spend the entire year building a real physical product for our final huzzah! I had seen several previous years projects, some were viable products I could see myself using. The best example was this project that was essentially Tile or more relevant now, Apple AirTags. They spent a whole year building this real product that real people would use and at the end they just scrapped the entire thing. I was personally offended. Why would students spend so much time and effort on a product they could try to turn into a company and gain invaluable experience? I decided that <em>I</em> was not going to waste this opportunity. This is when I realized how much of an opportunist I am.</p>
