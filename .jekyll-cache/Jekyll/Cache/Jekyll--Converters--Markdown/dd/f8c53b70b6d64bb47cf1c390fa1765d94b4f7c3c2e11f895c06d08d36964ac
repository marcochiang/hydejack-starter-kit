I"Ş<p>Before understanding how I even got into FAANG, you need to understand how my academic ability couldnâ€™t have been more average. I maintained a solid B+/- all throughout high school, even dropped out of all my AP (advanced placement) classes within the first week because I forgot to do any of the summer assignments. I wasnâ€™t particularly a high achiever compared to my â€œhardoâ€ (a term I learned later on that meant try hards) peers. This isnâ€™t a story of hard work and Ivy League privelege but rather preparation and working smart, not hard.</p>

<p>I went to everyoneâ€™s safety school, the last resort nicknamed ZooMass Slamherst for itâ€™s notorious partying shenanigans often ending up in the media outlets for itâ€™s riots. Even there where I studied Eletrical Engineering, which I quickly dropped because there was too much math to Computer Engineering, I was struggling hard and perceivably failing many of my engineering exams.</p>
