<p>It had been one year of dating my mainland chinese girlfriend. We met back in 2014 by chance at a fundraising event and 3 years later, somehow, started dating while still being separated by thousands of miles but thatâ€™s a story for another day.</p>

<p>I never fully understood what she did for a living but I knew she studied fashion design and that she owned a wedding dress rental company in China. I thought that was so cool. I was dating a real boss lady. Sometimes Iâ€™d be confused as to what she saw in me but then sheâ€™d ask me to make her a website or lend one of my other technical skills - my true value as a partnerâ€¦ free labor ;)</p>

<p>One day she asks me if I want to start a company with her in the U.S. a wedding dress rental company just like hers but online only. We would be able to leverage her existing connections among many other resources to kick start this venture together. I thought it was a terrible idea. The business potential was absolutely there. There was essentially no competition - we even scored the domain name <strong>weddingdressforrent.com</strong>. It was just that based on our dynamic, I felt starting a business together wouldâ€™ve been risky in terms of adding unneeded stress to our relationship. We already had a language barrier because our native languages were not the same. TLDR I hired a tutor to teach me mandarin after an epic failure of a date we went on back in 2015.</p>

<p>I still said yes. Iâ€™m an opportunist and I couldnâ€™t give up this chance to start an ecommerce business with a loved one. As difficult as I predicted it to be, I wouldnâ€™t regret the experience.</p>

<p>Turns out anytime we jumped on a call and talked about business, there was a 50% chance of us arguing. It was a lot of my partner telling me what to do, scolding me for doing something wrong or for not listening clearly. I knew nothing about this wedding dress business so I was very naive. I had to constantly remind myself to not take things personally and to find a healthy way of communicating with her.</p>

<p>Ideally, personal and business can be separated just like on the T.V. show, How I Met Your Mother. Whenever Lily and Marshall got into an argument they could pause their argument at any time to kiss and make up and continue the argument at a later time â¤. Sadly that is not how real life works and often times an argument can leave a bitter taste.</p>

<p>However, thatâ€™s just a tiny unpleasant fraction of this whole experience. I admire my partner so much for what sheâ€™s accomplished and what sheâ€™s capable of. Iâ€™ve learned so much from her and was tasked with building a Shopify store as well as handling all operations in the U.S. including customer service, shipping, and cleaning.</p>

<h2 id="my-failure">My Failure</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m not afraid to admit that this business was a failure, or more so - I failed this business. With my partner in China and me on my own in the U.S. running a business Iâ€™m not passionate about, it just ultimately made sense to dissolve the company. I didnâ€™t enjoy answering all the phone calls, responding to all the yelp inquiries, emails, cleaning the dresses after customers dragged them through dirt and grass.</p>

<p>Other than those manual tasks, Wedding Dress For Rent ran itself, the service is a no brainer for brides to be. We didnâ€™t need to do any advertising. People came looking for us because there are so few companies offering environmentally/financially friendly high end dresses. I still think itâ€™s a great idea, just not for me.</p>

<p>In 2022 after filing my taxes and making the final CA $800 payment to the evil Franchise Tax Board, I mailed in the company dissolution papers. My hands were already full as Iâ€™ve moved onto a new venture: <a href="https://reddoortelevision.com">Red Door TV</a>.</p>
