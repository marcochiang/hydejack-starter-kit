I"­<p>Is it intimidating to intern in FAANG when you went to a public school and everyone else went to prestigious schools like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford? Yes, especially for me because I was the student who copied everyoneâ€™s homework assignments and organized study groups just to ask the smart kids questions about a million things I didnâ€™t understand. I couldnâ€™t rely on anyone during this internship because whether or not I receive a full-time offer at the end of the summer depended on what I could achieve alone.</p>

<p>I was expected to build a complete web application from scratch, something Iâ€™ve never done before. I didnâ€™t have my mentor who taught me everything about maintaining an existing code base to hold my hand. I felt royally screwed just a few weeks into the internship after all the excitement and novelty of being in FAANG died down. It was my first time living in CA and I was set up in a sweet apartment with other FAANG interns and I got ahead of myself thinking of all the fun activities Iâ€™d be getting into that summerâ€¦</p>

<p>Regrettably, I signed myself up for way too much that summer. On top of my internship, I was still the sole developer for my Universityâ€™s website so I had to work after hours. Not only that, I signed up for a discrete algorithms online course because I was behind on my requirements and didnâ€™t want to take that class during the semester because I heard it was way too hard.</p>
