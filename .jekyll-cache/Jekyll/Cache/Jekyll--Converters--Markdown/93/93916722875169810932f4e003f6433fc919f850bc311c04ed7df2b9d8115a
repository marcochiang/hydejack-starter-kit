I"B<p>I’ve been a <em>software engineer</em> my whole career but I follow the path of jack of all trades in that I dabble in areas including but not limited to mobile, web, and even design. I don’t particularly enjoy doing the same things in repetition so I tend to opt for a variety of responsibilities at work. I maintain a lack of enthusiasm to dive deep into any particular technology and become a master. I’ve become more and more interested in the high level and overseeing the product rather than the implementation. Which led to my interest in switching careers.</p>
