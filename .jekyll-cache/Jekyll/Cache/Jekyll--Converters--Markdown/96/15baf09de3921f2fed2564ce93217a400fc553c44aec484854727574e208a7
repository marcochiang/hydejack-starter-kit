I"<p>Is it intimidating to intern in FAANG when you went to a public school and everyone else went to prestigious schools like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford? Yes, especially for me because I was the student who copied everyone’s homework assignments and organized study groups just to ask the smart kids questions about a million things I didn’t understand. I couldn’t rely on anyone during this internship because whether or not I receive a full-time offer at the end of the summer depended on what I could achieve alone.</p>
