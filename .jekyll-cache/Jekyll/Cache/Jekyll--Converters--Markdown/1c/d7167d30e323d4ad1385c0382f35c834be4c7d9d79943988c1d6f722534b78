I"$<p>Before understanding how I even got into FAANG, you need to understand how my academic ability couldn’t have been more average. I maintained a solid B+/- all throughout high school, even dropped out of all my AP (advanced placement) classes within the first week because I forgot to do any of the summer assignments. I wasn’t particularly a high achiever compared to my “hardo” (a term I learned later on that meant try hards) peers. This isn’t a story of traditional hard work and Ivy League privelege but rather preparation and working smart.</p>

<p>I went to everyone’s safety school, the last resort nicknamed ZooMass Slamherst for it’s notorious partying shenanigans often ending up in the media outlets for it’s riots. Even there where I first studied Eletrical Engineering, but quickly dropped for Computer Engineering because there was too much math, I was struggling hard and perceivably failing many of my engineering exams. I quickly realized I wouldn’t succeed if I only relied on my grades. I somehow figured out along the way that I needed to differentiate myself from the crowd. I couldn’t just do the bare minimum and put class projects on my resume. I became president of a dance and culture organization, got an on campus job in repairing student laptops, and applied for a web development job I was highly unqualified for.</p>

<p>I figured having some real world web development experience would be incredibly applicable to potential employers and boy was I right. I had heard that Facebook was developed in PHP and I saw a job listing for an experienced web developer in PHP for the off campus housing website. The experience requirement didn’t deter me because I’ve never been one to follow the rules. I applied anyway and during the interview I immediately admitted that I had zero experience with web development. I guaranteed my full committment and my desire to master what the current developer had to teach. I won him over with my personality and charisma. He then became one of the rare mentors in my life with the biggest impact.</p>

<p>Disregarding my GPA, which was around a 3.3, by sophomore year I had built a pretty decent resume that stood out. I landed my first big tech interview with Cisco. I was not confident with my interviewing abilities because data structures and algorithms were my weakest point. Many peers recommended praticing “Cracking the Code Interview” which had hundreds of interview problem I could practice. It just reminded me of SAT’s and I didn’t want to study on top of my already stressful exams. I understand people way better than data structures and so with the interview prep information I received from the company I did some research into my interviewers. Google, LinkedIn, I dug up whatever I could find so if I failed the technical portion of the interview I could distract them with personal questions. That’s exactly how it turned out… I bombed a simple data structures question but I had found something interesting</p>
